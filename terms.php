    </p>

    <p>
        <h5>Respect To Others</h5>
        Our community must respect each other.
         <ul>
            <li class="display-block">1. You will not post content or take any action on Playdoe that infringes or violates someone else's rights or otherwise violates the law.</li>
            <li class="display-block">2. We can remove any content or information you post on Playdoe if we believe that it violates our policies as listed below:</li>
         </ul>
    <h5>What type of content can I not post?</h5>
    <small>
        Here is a list of content that is under no means tolerable:
        <ul>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger display-block">Any content that depicts committing a crime</li>
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger display-block">Racist behaviour or bullying tactics </li>

    </small>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h5>Abuse of Point Accumulation</h5>
        Abusing the platform to increase point totals will not be tolerated. Duplicate posts are in direct violation of our content policy.
        If duplicate posts are detected, you account could be subject to suspension or termination. Sharing content that does
        not have context or is of low quality is also a violation of our content policy and subjects your account to suspension or termination.
        You are encouraged to share content others can enjoy and engage with via a like or comment.
        Playdoe reserves the right to determine if any content posted meets our policy standards.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h5>Rewards</h5>
        What is offered for rewarding of points is subject to change at anytime. Any cash reward provided will be provided via a
        third party application which currently stands as Venmo and PayPal. It is the member's responsibility to provide accurate
        information. If there is an errant deposit to the wrong bank account, remedy will be at the discretion of the application that
        handles the transaction, as Playdoe bears no responsibility for recovering misappropriated funds. Playdoe is only provided a member's email address as an indication as to what account should receive the
        deposited funds and should never be provided any banking account or routing information. Playdoe allows its members to determine
        what business they receive a gift card for. If the business selected by a member does not offer a gift card or does not offer it for
        the amount the accumulated points call for, Playdoe will attempt to determine what other business a member would want a gift card for.
        Processing rewards can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours.

    </p>

    <p>
        <h5>Advertisement</h5>
        Our goal is to deliver advertising content that is valuable to our members and advertisers. In order to help us do that,
        we will use the information you provide in your profile to help provide the most interesting
            products and services.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h5>Term Updates</h5>
